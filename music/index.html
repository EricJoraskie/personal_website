      <h1>Music</h1>
    </header>

    <p>During my freshman year at Northwestern (2013), I became interested in digital music production.</p>
<p>I purchased a MIDI device, the M-Audio Keystation Mini 32, because it was the cheapest and smallest one I could find, and it came with a simple software called Ignite, which I used to make loops.  I was gifted a copy of Sony ACID Music studio (a Digital Audio Workstation) and developed a process where after creating instrumental loops in Ignite, I would open them in ACID to polish them into a full piece. None of the below songs contain any kind of sampling, and each loop of each instrument is original, created on my Mini 32.</p>
<p>All this being said, haven’t spent much time making music since 2015, but a few of them are pretty decent, and I thought it would be fun to include them here.</p>
<p>None of them are named… It is what it is.</p>
