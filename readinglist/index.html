    <p>I read a lot.   (A more extensive list can be found <a href="/readinglist/othersuggestedreads">here</a>)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually <a href="#nonfiction">nonfiction</a> but I&rsquo;ve included some of my favorite <a href="#fiction">novels</a> too. Here is a short list containing eight of my favorites I&rsquo;d be willing to risk my recommendation reputation on.</p>
<p>Previously, I&rsquo;d linked all of the titles to their page on Goodreads, but I despise how cluttered the site is and have since discovered <a href="https://www.thestorygraph.com/" target="_blank">StoryGraph</a>; it&rsquo;s an up-and-coming competitor which supports <a href="https://bookshop.org/" target="_blank">Bookshop.org</a> if you&rsquo;re in the mood for some good Amazon alternatives. All of the authors are linked to the best info source I could quickly find.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all great reads, so if you do decide to pick one up, I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<h1 id="nonfiction">Nonfiction</h1>
<p><img src="/images/books/behave.jpg" alt="Behave cover"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1ec69071-6906-44cb-b6ac-40aa484edbfe" target="_blank">Behave</a>  &ndash;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky" target="_blank">Robert Sapolsky</a>
<ul>
<li>This book is a full tour of the biological underpinnings of human behavior in a wide variety of contexts. It&rsquo;s thorough and readable, albeit a little under 700 pages so it may take some time to tackle&hellip; but it is well worth it. It&rsquo;s neuro-heavy, but there are quick primers on neuroscience, endocrinology and proteins in the appendices for audiences without backgrounds in those topics, so I imagine a determined person with little science background could still enjoy it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/books/gg&amp;s.jpg" alt="Guns, Germs, and Steel cover"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/535740e0-7c38-47ae-93ed-b692ed07a9b0" target="_blank">Guns, Germs and Steel</a>  &ndash;  <a href="http://jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Jared Diamond</a>
<ul>
<li>GG&amp;S is essentially a rundown of the environmental and anthropological reasons global human society has arrived where it is today. It&rsquo;s also a long read but is well written and provides great context for modern history. The arguments put together by Diamond are solid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/books/scale.jpg" alt="Scale cover"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/dd368201-e7e5-4f18-a27d-79645fa0047f" target="_blank">Scale</a>  -  <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/geoffrey-west" target="_blank">Geoffrey West</a>
<ul>
<li>This is easily one of the coolest books I&rsquo;ve ever read and one of my favorites to reference. Oversimplified, it&rsquo;s about how characteristics of &ldquo;living systems&rdquo; (animals, cities and companies) change as the size of the systems themselves change. It&rsquo;s full of really interesting science, although the writing tends to wander occasionally so be prepared. Did you know that when a tree branches, the cross-sectional area of the branches is equal to the cross-sectional area of the limb that branched? The same goes for your arteries. I won&rsquo;t spoil why though, you&rsquo;ll have to read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/books/why_we_sleep.jpg" alt="Why We Sleep cover"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/35763626-fcb9-4659-9955-5219a402a057" target="_blank">Why We Sleep</a>  &ndash;  <a href="https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Walker</a>
<ul>
<li><strong>For additional context</strong>: When I was a freshman at Northwestern, the other freshman football players and I were part of a sleep study conducted by the founders of <a href="https://www.risescience.com/" target="_blank">Rise Science</a> (they were PhD students at the time). After observing first hand the enormous benefits of actually taking care of my sleep, I became a bit more committed to getting a good night&rsquo;s rest than the pre-educated version of myself.<br>
I recommend this book to pretty much anyone who will listen because its important information for everyone to have. It&rsquo;s a light read as far as science goes so it should be accessible to anyone. Even if you don&rsquo;t want to get on board 100% with his conclusions, I think it would be difficult for anyone to finish this and not agree that good sleep is crucial to your physical and mental well-being, <em>maybe even more so than diet and exercise</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="fiction">Fiction</h1>
<p><img src="/images/books/breakfast_of_champions.jpg" alt="Breakfast of Champions cover"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/54297fc4-9d18-4a31-b830-43ceb0a066f2" target="_blank">Breakfast of Champions</a>  &ndash;  <a href="https://www.vonnegut.com/home" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Or anything by Vonnegut really&hellip; although this and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9593.Gal_pagos" target="_blank">Galapagos</a> are my favorites.</em><br>
If you&rsquo;re a reader and you&rsquo;ve never read anything by Kurt Vonnegut, you&rsquo;re missing out. His novels aren&rsquo;t just novels, they&rsquo;re genuine literature in the sense that they are doing far more than just telling a story and I appreciate the worldviews he regularly conveys in his work. Plus they&rsquo;re quirky and funny. Can&rsquo;t miss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/books/jurassic_park.jpg" alt="Jurassic Park cover"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9ed47b92-7bb2-49a6-b387-8dbc7826accc" target="_blank">Jurassic Park</a>  &ndash;  <a href="https://www.michaelcrichton.com/" target="_blank">Michael Crichton</a>
<ul>
<li>I grew up watching the Jurassic Park movies, and this is a classic case of &ldquo;the book is WAY better than the movie&rdquo;.<br>
Most of the books I&rsquo;ve read by Michael Crichton  aren&rsquo;t literature in the same way Vonnegut&rsquo;s works are, but he sure can tell an enthralling story. I believe that Jurassic Park comes close, in that he makes it a point to impart societal critiques at different points throughout the book. Plus it&rsquo;s exciting and about dinosaurs, so what&rsquo;s not to like?</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><img src="/images/books/the_master_and_margarita.jpg" alt="The Master and Margarita cover"></p>

<ul>
<li>This one is a chaotic ride; the writing is fantastic and the story is funny, interesting and weird. I think this might be my riskiest recommendation, but it&rsquo;s a super fun book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/books/all_quiet_on_the_western_front.jpg" alt="All Quiet on the Western Front cover"></p>

<ul>
<li>Heart-wrenching. &ldquo;I soon found out this much:- terror can be endured so long as a man simply ducks;- but it kills, if a man thinks about it&rdquo;</li>
