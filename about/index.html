    <p>Welcome to my personal site! I&rsquo;m currently an AI Researcher at JHUAPL.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an unusual path into AI Research. Injuries brought my football career to an early conclusion toward the end of my sophomore year at Northwestern University, leading me to focus my attention on neuroscience. After falling in love with the subject, I contemplated both the pursuit of a PhD in neuroscience and medical school at different points throughout my senior year, but neither path was tantalizing enough for me to take the leap.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, I worked in a few roles (pharmaceutical competitive intelligence software sales, personal training, ACT prep tutoring) that provided me with more insight into what I wanted from my future endeavors as well as a number of valuable skills and experiences. After turning to computer science to help satisfy my intellectual and creative curiosity, my neuroscience background naturally catalyzed an interest in AI, providing focus for my graduate studies and a wellspring of insight for my research.</p>
<p>Neurobiology is still (by far) my favorite field of study, but the ability afforded by computer science &ndash; to create something from nothing more than an idea &ndash; has certainly kept me entertained.</p>
<p>Take a look around to see some of my public projects and hobbies, and feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn!</p>
