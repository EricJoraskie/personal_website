      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>My name is Eric Joraskie and I am a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an unusual path into CS. Prior to a string of injuries resulting in my football career prematurely coming to an end, I thought I&rsquo;d end up playing in the NFL. Upon medically retiring from football toward the end of my sophomore year at Northwestern University, I began to focus my studies on neuroscience, which I found to be exciting enough to keep my attention. Falling in love with neuroscience led me to contemplate both the pursuit of a PhD in neuroscience and medical school at different points throughout my senior year, but neither path was tantalizing enough for me to take the leap.</p>
<p>Newly graduated and on my own, I worked in a few roles that left me longing for more intellectual stimulation (pharmaceutical competitive intelligence software sales, personal training, ACT prep tutoring). Although none were a perfect fit, each provided me with more insight into what I wanted from my future endeavors. I spent much of my free time searching for a path more closely aligned with what I wanted out of a career, and after much introspection and experimentation, it became clear that computer science could offer me a route to approach the complex problems I found interesting and cared about.</p>
<p>I enrolled in Northeastern&rsquo;s ALIGN program &ndash; a graduate program designed to bridge non-CS majors to a master&rsquo;s degree &ndash; and the experience has been as positive as I could have hoped. I enjoy writing code, coming up with new software ideas, and am always looking for new ways to apply my skills. At the time I was changing fields, my neuroscience background naturally catalyzed an interest in AI, although I only had a vague idea of what AI was. As I reach the end of my degree program, I&rsquo;ve found myself (I suppose unsurprisingly) leaning into it; machine learning, classical AI methods, causal inference, and more experimental fronts like neurosymbolic reasoning.</p>
<p>I once again regularly contemplate pursuing a PhD, with a strong interest in AGI, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>Take a look around to see some of my public projects and hobbies, and feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn!</p>
