    <p>Welcome to my personal site! I&rsquo;m currently an AI Researcher at JHUAPL.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an unusual path into AI research. Toward the end of my sophomore year at Northwestern University, injuries brought my football career to an early conclusion. I turned my attention to neuroscience, and after falling in love with the subject, I contemplated both the pursuit of a Ph.D. in neuroscience, and medical school, at different points throughout my senior year.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, having decided against immediately attending graduate school, I worked in a few roles (pharmaceutical competitive intelligence software sales, personal training, ACT prep tutoring) that provided me with more insight into what I wanted from my future endeavors as well as a number of valuable skills and experiences. After turning to computer science to help satisfy my intellectual and creative curiosity, my neuroscience background naturally catalyzed an interest in AI, which provided focus for my master&rsquo;s studies and a wellspring of insight for my research.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun designing and developing software to make computers do human things.</p>
