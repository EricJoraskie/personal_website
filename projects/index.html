    <p>Here are a couple of small projects that I&rsquo;ve worked on with links to what is available. I will update this page as I make more code available on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="grand-canyon-traffic-detectionhttpsgithubcomericjoraskiegrand_canyon_traffic_detection"><a href="https://github.com/EricJoraskie/grand_canyon_traffic_detection" target="_blank">Grand Canyon Traffic Detection</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/projects/isTheGrandCanyonBusy.png" alt="RV detector sample"></p>
<p>This project originated from a quick drive I wanted to take up to the Grand Canyon. I was unable to find any indication of how busy the park was that day, so I ended up using deep learning to solve the problem myself. This project is still under active development, and I plan to host a Flask site somewhere in the not too distant future!</p>
<h2 id="optical-escapehttpsgithubcomericjoraskieopticalescape"><a href="https://github.com/EricJoraskie/OpticalEscape" target="_blank">Optical Escape</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/projects/optical_escape.png" alt="Optical Escape Screenshot"></p>
<p>This was a project I created for a graduate graphics class. It ended up being a lot of fun to put together and I think enough of a challenge that it was fun to play through.  It uses SDL2 and OpenGL.</p>
<h2 id="othellohttpsgithubcomericjoraskieboard_games"><a href="https://github.com/EricJoraskie/board_games" target="_blank">Othello</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/projects/othello.gif" alt="Othello Game gif"></p>
<p>The first complete project I built! I wrote the code for the entire game, and a rules based AI that crushed most (~95%) of the people it played. It uses <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> for UI and python. Feel free to clone it and try to win!</p>
